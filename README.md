# CrontabSublime

version 0.1

A package I wrote for Crontab Syntax Highlighting since the old package is quite outdated and doesn't work brilliantly.

Arguably a dying thing with systemd, but crontabs are still a quick and dirty way to get things running without too much effort, so there is still some use

Will upload to package control once I've ironed out the bugs
